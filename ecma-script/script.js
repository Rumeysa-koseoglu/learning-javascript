//?Ecma Script

/*ECMAScript is a set of rules, and JavaScript is a language that follows these rules. 
  Some browsers do not support some js codes but ES  codes , espec'ally ECMAScript 1-6 are fully supported in all modern browsers.
  Keywords like let, const were included in js with ES6
  
  in short , we can write codes supported by every browser with the ES codes included in js*/
